j# Machine Learning Algorithms
I am actively learning and applying Machine Learning algorithms to solve real-world problems. My focus is on building practical, data-driven solutions using various ML techniques, including classification, regression, clustering, and anomaly detection.

Through hands-on projects, I aim to deepen my understanding of:

     •  Data preprocessing and feature engineering

     •  Model selection and evaluation

     •  Supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms

     •  Real-world applications like fraud detection, recommendation systems, and predictive analytics

I believe in learning by doing and continuously improving my skills through projects and experimentation.
